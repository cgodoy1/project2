<p>The moment we have all been waiting for, and easily the most controversial discussion when it comes to rookie of the year. Personally Donovan is clearly the better scorer/shooter but he is worse at everything else. Ben Simmons averages more assist and rebounds making him the better overall player. Some people however have the audacity to call Ben Simmons not a rookie. Some examples of this were at TD Garden vs the Boston Celtics when the crowd chanted "Not a Rookie" to Ben Simmons when he was shooting free throws. Donavon Mitchel even wore a hoodie with "Rookie?" in the front. Jeff Pearlman a longtime sportswriter and David Papineau an expert on "how we should define a rookie" both agree that Ben Simmons is considered a rookie. On top of that Blake Griffin was injured shortly after he got drafted just like Ben Simmons and he came back and won the Rookie of The Year award just like Ben Simmons. Unlike Ben Simmons though, he wasn't questioned if he was really a rookie or not.
