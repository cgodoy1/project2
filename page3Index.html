<p>16.1 vs 15.8</p>
<p>6.3 vs 8.1</p>
<p>1.8 vs 8.2</p>
<p>Kyle Kuzma is a top 5 rookie from the 2017-2018 season. This guy was also considered the steal of the draft and one of the most exciting rookies to watch. Even with all of this being considered Ben Simmons is still the better player. Sure Kyle might be the better scorer and even the amount of rebounds are close between the two but he can't compete when it comes to floor vision. Ben Simmons averages 8.1 assist to Kyle Kuzma's 1.8
