  <div class="grid-item"><a>Unfortunately he broke his ankle in training camp and was out for the 2016-2017 NBA season. It was in the 2017-2018 NBA season he made his debut. In his first NBA season he averaged 15.8 points, 8.1 rebounds, 8.2 assist, 1.7 steals, and 0.9 blocks. It was these numbers that got him the praise of NBA Hall of Famer Julius Erving calling him a â€œonce-in-a-lifetime-type player". Ben Simmons has also earned comparisons to NBA legend Magic Johnson and the best player in the NBA LeBron James. Ben Simmons was the 2017-2018 NBA ROTY and shows high promise.</a></div>
